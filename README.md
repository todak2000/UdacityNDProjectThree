![Diagram of CI/CD Pipeline we will be building.](udapeople.png)
This project is the third project (Udapeople) in the Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree program which requires that I use my knowledge of Continuous Integration Continous Deployment (CI/CD) to:
- Explain the fundamentals and benefits of CI/CD to achieve, build, and deploy automation for cloud-based software products.
- Utilize Deployment Strategies to design and build CI/CD pipelines that support Continuous Delivery processes.
- Utilize a configuration management tool to accomplish deployment to cloud-based servers.
- Surface critical server errors for diagnosis using centralized structured logging.
